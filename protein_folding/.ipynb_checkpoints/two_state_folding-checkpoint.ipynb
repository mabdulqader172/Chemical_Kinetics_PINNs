    "## The Two State Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest kinetic model that defines the process of folding a protein is the two state kinetic model. The two states are the unfolded state $U$ and folded state $N$ of protein. This kinetic model is relevant for proteins that are only a single domain as they are sufficiently small enough to be able to fold and unfold reversibly without any external assistance. This kinetic model assumes that a protein has no known intermediates (a stable structure that is not completely folded or unfolded).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\require{mhchem} \\Large{\\ce{U <=>[\\, k_f \\,][\\, k_u \\,] N}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main kinetic values that drive this process, the rate of folding $k_f$ and rate of unfolding $k_u$. The equlibrium $K_{eq}$ is determined by the ratio of these two rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large{K_{eq} = \\frac{k_u}{k_f}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$K_{eq}$ is a key value as it allows us to determine the stability of the single domain protein $\\Delta G^{UN}$ given some temperature $T$ in Kevlin.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large{\\Delta G^{UN} = -RT\\ln(K_{eq})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The function that represents the change of the folded population based on the kinetic model can be defined by the following differential equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large{\\frac{d[N]}{dt} = k_f[U] - k_u[N]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the following mass balance law enforced where $[N]_0$ and $[U]_0$ is the inital population of folded and unfolded protein respectively. This is effectively the law of conservation (mass cannot be created nor destroyed).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large{[N]_0 + [U]_0 = [N] + [U]}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The mass balance law allows us to use substitution to make the ODE all in terms of $N$. Meaning we only need to track the change of a single population.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large{\\frac{d[N]}{dt} = k_f([N]_0 + [U]_0 - [N]) - k_u[N]}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Tracking only the folded population is sufficent as the mass balance allows us to determine that the change in $U$ is the opposite of $N$.\n",

    "The following ODE is a linear first-order ODE and the general solution for the ODE is below where $c$ is a constant that can be solved for given a set of boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large{[N](t) = \\frac{k_f([N]_0 + [U]_0)}{(k_f + k_u)} + ce^{-(k_f + k_u)t}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example, a solution of protein was in acidic solution and was returned to physiological pH. The initial condition would be that there is no folded protein present in solution at $t = 0$ meaning that the following condition $[N](t = 0) = [N]_0 = 0$ is present. This means we can now solve for $c$ which gives us the specific solution for $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large{[N](t) = \\frac{k_f([N]_0 + [U]_0)}{(k_f + k_u)} + \\left([N]_0 - \\frac{k_f([N]_0 + [U]_0)}{(k_f + k_u)}\\right)e^{-(k_f + k_u)t}}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "this function as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$ reaches the following limit which we define as $[N]_{eq}$. This is the expected folded population when equlibrium is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\large{[N](t \\rightarrow \\infty) = [N]_{eq} = \\frac{k_f([N]_0 + [U]_0)}{(k_f + k_u)}}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "We can finally substitute $[N]_{eq}$ to simplify the ODE solution we have above, the solution we have below will be used to generate data to train our neural networks with.\n",

    "\n",
    "The purpose is to test if we infact can teach black box methods to predict properties that adhere to physical laws. The conveinence of having a known solution to this ODE is powerful in that we can generate a dataset to train the model with and to test if NNs can infact adhere to physical laws and constraints that we see in the real world."
